The members of KRUG organized a Code Retreat on Dec 15th as part of the Global Day of Code Retreat 2013. [Vishnu Gopal](https://twitter.com/vishnugopal) joined us as the facilitator.

The event was attended by 35 people. Many of the participants were unfamiliar with test driven development, so one of the afternoon pairing sessions was replaced by a live coding session by Vishnu, where he demonstrated how to solve the Conway's Game of Life using TDD.

The event was sponsored by [Mobme Wireless](http://www.mobme.in) and [Ruby Kitchen](http://rubykitchen.in), and was hosted by [WowMakers](http://www.wowmakers.com) and [Startup Village](http://www.startupvillage.in).
